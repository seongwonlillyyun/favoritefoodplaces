     <div class="food">It's my favorite restaruant in the world! It's alreaday wellknown by Berliner and tourists. It's possible that you have to wait a lot if you go there at lunch time. I really recommend to visit at 12p.m. I've eaten only Pho which is vietnames noodle. If you enjoy eating spicy food, you can add some spicy sauce there! If you eat this noodle with chilli from the sauce, you would love to come back again! - Especially in winter! perfect food!

    <div class="food">I'm not the person who finds to eat food from my countries aborad but sometimes I missed korean food! (TMI:I'm very bad at cooking so I treid not to cook korean food in the kitchen of my dormitory... I really didn't want to ruin the kitchen!) I found this restaurant and i was really saticified with there! A lot of korean visit here to eat korean food and the owner is korean. (It's very important) I went there with my German friend who stayed in Korea as exchange student for about 1 year and he really liked there! If you want to try REAL korean food in Berlin, you have to visit! But sometimes workers made some mistakes about paying...! (I think they are not good at German/English)</div>

   <div class="food"> Döner kebab is a dish of Turkish origin made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks.The modern sandwich variant of döner kebab originated and was popularized in 1970s West Berlin by Turkish immigrants. This was recognized by the Berlin-based Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in Europe in 2011.
  <p>Mustafa's Gemüse kebap is the most famous kebap imbiss by tourists. Because real Berliner don't know why this imbiss is so famous to tourists. And it means also that you have to wait for a long time to get this kebap! I've eaten this kebap twice in my life but i didn't wait longtime (because it was winter and the time was not meal time but i waited a little bit though) The special thing of this kebap is grilled vegetables. My Japanese friends said that they can't eat another kebap after eating this kebap! hahahah But to me... I like kebap a lot, so i would eat another one of course.  </p>

  <div class="food"> Do you like cinamon rolls? If yes, your destination is here! They have various kinds of cinamon rolls (it's called zimtschnecken in German) and coffee :) One of Berliner's favroite places! And you can also get other like sandwiches or just normal bread (brot) I really liked to have a cinamon rolls with a smoothie at this cafe. It made me feel I'm real Berliner hahaha
  <P>And there are a lot of cafes in this area - I recommend you guys to go there and get a coffee and feel Berlin vibe! Viel Spaß!</P>
